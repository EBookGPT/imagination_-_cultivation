Okay, I'm ready to be brutally honest about your story. You've got a decent premise, but the execution needs a lot of work. Here's a breakdown:

**What Works:**

* **Interesting Premise:**  The idea of a black hole dantian and the power of imagination in cultivation is intriguing. It has the potential to be a unique twist on the xianxia genre.
* **Worldbuilding:** You've established a basic cultivation system with levels and stages. 

**What Needs Work:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:**  This is the biggest issue.  The writing is overly descriptive and relies heavily on telling rather than showing. For example, you tell us James is a "typical 21st century man" with nerdy hobbies, but you don't show us how he acts, what he does, what he thinks. Instead of describing the mall as a "gilded cage," show us the cramped office, the flickering fluorescent lights, the bored customers. 
* **Lack of Dialogue:**  The dialogue is mostly exposition, lacking any real spark or character development. You need to create realistic conversations that reveal the characters' personalities and motivations.
* **Passive Voice:**  The story is filled with passive voice.  Replace sentences like "He was greeted by the cacophony of clanging bells" with "The clanging bells greeted him."  Active voice creates more vivid, engaging writing.
* **Clunky Exposition:**  You dump a lot of information about cultivation levels in a way that feels forced and unnatural.  Find more organic ways to reveal this information, like having characters discuss it or having Tang Zhong discover it through his own experiences. 
* **Uninspired Characters:** Tang Zhong and Tang Liang feel like generic characters.  Give them unique traits, quirks, motivations, and flaws.  
* **Unrealistic Worldbuilding:** You mention a wealthy merchant family, but there's no sense of political intrigue, societal norms, or any real conflict beyond Tang Zhong's cultivation. 
* **Lack of Tension:**  There's not a lot of tension in the story.  The stakes feel low, and the reader doesn't feel invested in Tang Zhong's success. 

**How to Improve:**

1. **Focus on Showing:**  Instead of describing Tang Zhong's anxieties, show him fidgeting with his clothes, biting his nails, or avoiding eye contact.  
2. **Write Engaging Dialogue:**  Imagine a real conversation between Tang Zhong and Tang Liang about the black hole dantian.  Make it a back-and-forth, filled with sarcasm, frustration, and maybe even a bit of humor.
3. **Use Active Voice:**  Instead of "He was greeted by the clanging bells," write "The clanging bells greeted him." 
4. **Weave Worldbuilding into the Story:**  Instead of dumping information about cultivation levels, show Tang Zhong practicing, struggling with the techniques, and asking his brother for clarification.
5. **Create Compelling Characters:** Give Tang Zhong a reason to be more than just a "once in a thousand year genius."  What are his dreams? What does he fear?  Give Tang Liang a complex personality, maybe he's jealous of his brother's talent, or he has a hidden agenda. 
6. **Increase Tension and Stakes:**  What are the consequences if Tang Zhong fails? What threats are there in this world?  What political machinations are happening behind the scenes?

**A Few Specific Examples:**

* **Instead of:** "He longed for a world where magic was real, where he could wield a sword, cast spells, and explore vast, uncharted landscapes."
* **Write:** He closed his eyes, picturing himself battling a monstrous dragon on a snow-capped mountain, the wind whipping through his hair as he swung a glowing sword.  A smile played on his lips. 

* **Instead of:** "He tried to follow the methods Tang Liang had taught him, picturing himself as a vast, ancient tree..."
* **Write:**  Tang Zhong struggled to focus, his mind jumping from the image of a towering tree to a roaring dragon, then a glittering palace.  He cursed under his breath, "This tree thing is boring. I need something..." He inhaled deeply, trying to imagine...a black hole?

**Remember:**  Good writing is about showing, not telling.  Focus on crafting vivid imagery, creating realistic dialogue, and building suspense and tension.  Don't be afraid to take risks, to experiment with your writing style, and to embrace your imagination.  You've got a unique concept; now you need to give it life.
