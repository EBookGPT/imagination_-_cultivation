This is a good start, and you have a solid concept, but the execution needs a lot of work. Here's a breakdown of the critique:

**Problems:**

* **Too much telling, not enough showing:**  This is the biggest issue.  We get told about James's past life, his feelings, his longing, his determination, but we rarely see it. 
    * **Example:**  "He longed for a spark, a flicker of something more, a world where his imagination could be unleashed, where he could break free from the chains of his mundane existence."  This is telling us he's unhappy and wants more. Show us what makes him unhappy, show him daydreaming about his fantasy worlds, show the contrast between his mundane life and his imagined ones.
* **Lack of detail and immersion:** The worldbuilding feels very basic. We get a list of cultivation levels, but we don't see how those levels manifest in the world. What does a Qi Gathering cultivator look like?  How do they interact with the world?  What does a "medicinal bath" actually entail?
    * **Example:** Instead of "The smell of incense and exotic spices filling his nostrils," describe the specific incense, the unique spices, maybe even how they make him feel.
* **Weak dialogue:** The dialogue is mostly expository. Characters simply tell each other information. We need more natural, character-driven dialogue that reveals personality and relationships.
    * **Example:** "He was honored to be entrusted with your training, brother," Tang Liang said, his voice devoid of any emotion.  "We will begin with the basics. The first stage is Qi Gathering, the foundation upon which all further cultivation rests." This is bland and informative. Give Tang Liang a reason to say this, maybe he's trying to intimidate Zhong, maybe he's secretly excited about his brother's potential, maybe he's just bored with the task.
* **Unrealistic pacing:** The story rushes through key events. Tang Zhong goes from a novice to forming a dantian and being hailed as a genius too quickly. We need to see his struggles, his training, his setbacks, his moments of doubt. 
* **Bland characterization:**  The characters are underdeveloped. We don't get a clear sense of their personalities, their motivations, or their relationships with each other.
    * **Example:** Tang Ruogong is "a kind man," but what makes him kind? What are his aspirations? How does he feel about his son's unique abilities?
* **ClichÃ©d tropes:** While there's nothing inherently wrong with tropes, they should be used thoughtfully. The "once-in-a-thousand-year genius" trope needs some subversion or unique spin to avoid being predictable.

**Suggestions:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of telling us about James's past, show us his day in the mall, his interactions with customers, his escape into fantasy games. Let us see how he struggles with his mundane life.
* **Immerse us in the world:** Give us vivid details about the sights, sounds, smells, and tastes of this new world.  Describe the city, the architecture, the clothing, the food. Let the reader experience it through Tang Zhong's senses.
* **Focus on dialogue:** Make the conversations more natural and revealing. Give characters distinct voices, let them banter, argue, and express their emotions.
* **Slow down the pacing:** Give Tang Zhong time to learn and grow. Show him struggling with Qi Gathering, experimenting with different techniques, making mistakes, and eventually finding his own path.
* **Develop characters:** Give each character a unique personality, motivations, and flaws. Explore their relationships, their conflicts, their dreams, and their fears.
* **Subvert tropes:**  Find a unique spin on the "genius" trope.  Maybe Tang Zhong is not a prodigy but a hard worker who just happens to have a unique ability. Maybe his genius comes with a price, a hidden flaw or a dangerous side effect. 

**Example Revision:**

Instead of:

>"He longed for a spark, a flicker of something more, a world where his imagination could be unleashed, where he could break free from the chains of his mundane existence."

Write:

>The fluorescent lights buzzed, turning the beige walls of his office into an oppressive, sterile cage. James stared at the spreadsheet on his screen, the numbers blurring before his eyes.  A sigh escaped his lips, the sound lost in the hum of the air conditioning.  His fingers itched to pick up his dice, to roll a twenty on a critical hit, to feel the surge of adrenaline as his character wielded a magical blade in a fantasy battle.  He longed for the escape, the thrill, the vibrant colors of a world where imagination was reality. 

This shows us James's dissatisfaction with his life, his yearning for something more, and his connection to his fantasy worlds without explicitly telling us. 

**Remember, writing is a process of revision. Don't be afraid to experiment, to rewrite, to try new approaches.  Be patient, be persistent, and you will craft a story that truly captivates your readers.**
